This is an STM32F072RBT6 based mcu board.

It contains the following features:
1. An ARM based STM32 microcontroller
2. An FT230 USB to UART transmitter that allows communication between the host computer and the MCU
3. A fully dedicated debug port. Labelled SWD.
4. 4 16 pin ports that are dedicated for communication with other boards. Such as SRAM, or FPGA's.

This design was made using KICAD. It's fully laid out, routed, and ready to be sent off for manufacturing.
